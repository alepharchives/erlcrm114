Quick Start
===========

Meant to work with https://github.com/jflatow/libcrm114 or similar.
Assuming you have already installed libcrm114 (and libtre, which libcrm114 depends on)::

        make test

The tests should pass, now add it as a rebar dep to your Erlang app::

        > {ok, Classifier} = erlcrm114:new().
        > {ok, Classifier} = erlcrm114:learn(Classifier, <<"text as a binary">>).
        > {ok, Classifier} = erlcrm114:learn(Classifier, <<"a counterexample">>, 1).
        > case erlcrm114:classify(Classifier, <<"text">>) of
               #result{bestmatch=0} ->
                 success; %% class 0
               #result{bestmatch=1} ->
                 failure; %% class 1
               ...
          end.

To get the result record definitions::

        -include("erlcrm114.hrl").

For more info on the classifiers / low-level api, read the libcrm114 docs.
Check the tests (e.g. https://github.com/jflatow/erlcrm114/blob/master/test/erlcrm114_test.erl ),
for some more usage examples.
